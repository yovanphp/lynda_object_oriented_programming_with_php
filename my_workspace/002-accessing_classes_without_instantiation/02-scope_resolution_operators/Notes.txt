The scope resolution operator, or in other terms the double colon, is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties and methods of a class.
I will be covering constants in the next video and overwriting properties and methods in the next chapter.

To use this token, you need the name of the Class followed by the double colon.
1. For a method, just add the name of the static method with parentheses and whatever arguments are needed.
2. For a property, add a dollar sign, then the name of the static property that you're accessing.

For example: $address::$valid_address_types

Use of the scope resolution operator is not limited to accessing static properties and methods, as I will demonstrate in the next video.
