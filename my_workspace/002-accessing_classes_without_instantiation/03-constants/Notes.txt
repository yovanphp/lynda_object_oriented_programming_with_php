A class constant is like a property with a value that never changes.
Constants are useful for defining things like error codes, data structure names, and things that have no need to change at runtime, if ever.
While there is no restriction built into PHP, best practice dictates that constant names are in all capital letters, separated by underscores.
Constants can only contain simple values, such as strings, Booleans and integers. Arrays will not work.
To define a constant, you start with the keyword const, followed by the name with no dollar sign, an assignment operator, and the value.
const ADDRESS_TYPE_RESIDENCE = 1;
const ADDRESS_TYPE_BUSINESS = 2;
const ADDRESS_TYPE_PARK = 3;

We did not specify that the address types be defined as a constant is that arrays are not allowed as constant values.
With that said, you can replace the hard-coded values with the constants that were just declared.

Similar to static properties, you use the scope resolution operator to access constants, only without the dollar sign.  Address::ADDRESS_TYPE_RESIDENCE, Address::ADDRESS_TYPE_BUSINESS, and Address::ADDRESS_TYPE_PARK
