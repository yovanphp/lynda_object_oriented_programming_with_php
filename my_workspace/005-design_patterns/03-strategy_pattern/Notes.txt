This may sound complex at first, but consider an example of deciding what to wear in the morning.

Is your red shirt clean?
If so, it can be worn.
If it isn't, is your blue shirt clean?
If yes, then it can be worn as well.
Go through all of your shirt options for this test. Is it clean?
You can prefer a particular shirt over another or just go with the last one you found.
If you don't have any clean shirts then you've run out of strategies and you've got a problem.
